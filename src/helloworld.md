# Hello World!

RuxOS uses the `make` tool to provide users with a complete and convenient way to run applications.

For a basic hello world app:
```
make A=apps/c/helloworld run
```
Parameter explanation:
* `A`: This parameter points to the application directory.

Just run this command, and a simple c app is started. An example of running results is as follows:
```
8888888b.                     .d88888b.   .d8888b.
